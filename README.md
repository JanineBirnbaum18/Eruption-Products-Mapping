# Eruption-Products-Mapping
Use publicly available satellite imagery to map volcanic eruption products

Volcanoes are natural hazards that endanger millions of people around the globe. A fundamental question outstanding in the field of volcanology is the accurate prediction of volcanic eruptions, and specifically the likely distribution of eruption products such as ash, lava flows, pyroclastic debris flows, and lahars. The key to making informed predicition lies in the interpretation of the rock record and observations from historic and modern volcanic eruptions. The goal of this project is to use numerical analyses to map eruption products from recent eruptions using satellite imagery which can help us identify processes that control the distribution of eruption products.

Analyses will include isolating landsat 8 scenes over select volcanic edifices before, after, and if available during volcanic eruptions. End-member spectra for different land cover types including vegetation, water, open soil, and recent volcanic products will be identified. A linear mixture analysis comparison between scenes before and after the eruption can be used to map the new flows and estimate the eruptive volume.
